No packets! - RF kill switch

If the module loads, but no packets are transferred you may have a SW based
radio kill switch.  All laptops have some capability to disable the radio
via a button or switch.  On some laptops that switch is physically tied to the
IPW2100; simply toggling the switch should enable the radio.

On other laptops, the switch is a button that when pressed requires some
software driver to send some hardware command to some other piece of hardware
on the laptop, that then controls the radio.  The driver currently has support
for the Averatec 5100P laptop's SW switch.  Support will be added for other
laptop vendors as we become aware of them and figure out how to enable the
radio.

To know if the radio is being disabled via the RF switch, perform the following:

% cat /proc/net/ipw2100/eth1/state
Radio is disabled by RF switch

If it says that, then your RF switch is currently disabling the radio.  The 
driver doesn't currently support switching back to the on state if you have a
physical RF switch (the radio may turn on and packets will work, but the proc
entry won't be updated)
